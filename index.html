    My name is Nathalie Theriault and I am a freshman at the University of Maine. I chose to go to UMO, because I grew up in a very small town in Maine and wanted to see what it was like to be a part of a larger community. I am very glad I chose to attend UMaine, because the atmosphere here is amazing. So far, everyone has been friendly and engaged in the school's culture.

    To best give you insight to my life, I have attached links to my instagram, twitter and my facebook accounts. They have best documented my life's adventures and the connections with people I have met over the years.
